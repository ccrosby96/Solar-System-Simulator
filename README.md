  * (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the Final Assignment? How could the instructor improve the final project? Seeing how truly large the sun is in comparion to us and the other rocky planets was very cool once I scaled them correctly. I had to implement a feature that upscales rocky planets just so you could see them well when they begin moving in the simulation.
